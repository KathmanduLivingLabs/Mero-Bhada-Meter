##What is Mero Bhada Meter ?
Mero Bhada Meter is Nepali for My Fare Meter. This is an app built for taxi travellers in Kathmandu Valley. 
There is a chance that while travelling in a taxi in Kathmandu, the meter might be tampered or the drivers might not want to go with the meter on. In such cases Mero Bhada Meter gives you an idea of approximate fare using GPS, OpenStreetMap and Government set taxi fare rates.

##How do i use Mero Bhada Meter?
Once you have the app installed in your phone there are two ways you can use Mero Bhada Meter. You can use it to calculate the fare by setting the starting point and destination point before the taxi ride or you can use real time gps tracking to check your fares during the taxi ride. 
To calculate the route before the ride open up app. You are presented with a map. If you longpress on the map you will get a menu where you can set Departure, Destination and Via Points. Once you have both departure and destination set your optimal route will be calculated and you will be presented with the calculated fare.
To do real time tracking just start the app and press the Start Tracking button on the top right of the app screen. A real time fare display will be updated on the top of the screen as you move. You can tally this fare with the fare on the Taxi meter. Due to the accuracy of GPS and other issues the rate may not be exactly the same but should provide you with a good estimate.

Yes , one of the best part about this app is you can use it completely offline. You can download the map data by pressing the menu button and then pressing download. This downloads the offline map and routhing data of Nepal to your phone. You can now press the menu button and go to prefrence from where you can enable the offline mode.
